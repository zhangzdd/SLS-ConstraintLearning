7.17
Several things done from Monday meeting
1. Adding regularization helped improved the optimization problem landscape, but is not the life saver
    1.1 Regularization on state response norm (phi) will introduce additional structure into the inverse game which is not always explainable
    1.2 Regularization via imposing input robust bounds can also greatly improve the roll-out quality, but the tube size is wrong 
        (error signals exceeding bounds)
2. All code migrated to python with cvxpy to facilitate comparison against Shuyu's code
3. Several possible culprits ruled out:
    3.1 Is Yalmip acting wierd? No, because the python implementation gave the same awful roll-outs
    3.2 Is it because the nature of the problem is weird (the optimizer will try to squeeze tube size in order to get closer to the wall)?
        No, I took Shuyu's code and implemented the same problem I am solving, and it worked, providing non-zero tube size
